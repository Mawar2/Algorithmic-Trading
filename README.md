# Algorithmic-Trading
Back Testing Data from Yahoo Finance using the PyAlgoTrade library. 


The purpose of the research was to determine which types of moving averages and technical indicators lead to optimal trading strategies. Our goal was to compare sets of trend-based algorithmic trading strategies by applying computational rules to historical stock market price data. I was tasked with implementing methods that applied these research based strategies to the PyAlgoTrade library. After gathering and analyzing data, I became more proficient in both the Pandas and Mathplotlib libraries. These tools have allowed me to generate relevant questions and have allowed me to investigate them through visualization. In conclusion, the data supported that the Simple Moving Average strategies were more profitable in the case of most companies when compared to the exponential moving average.
